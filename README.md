# **linid-im-front-corelib**

## **🧩 Overview**

`linid-im-front-corelib` is a TypeScript library designed as a core front-end module for the LinID Identity Management
ecosystem.
It provides shared interfaces, types, default services, and plugin-zone components used across the LinID front-end
applications, including:

- The **Vue.js/Quasar module federation host**
- The **remote plugin repositories**

This library ensures consistency across all front-end modules by centralizing common logic, validation tools, and data
structures for identity management features such as CRUD operations on persons, users, and related entities.

> This library is part of a larger ecosystem including Java back-end services, workflow APIs, multiple plugins, and
> front-end modules.

## **✨ Features**

- Shared **TypeScript interfaces and types**
- Core **services** used across LinID front-end apps
- **Plugin zone components** for dynamic front-end plugin integration
- Common validation utilities for identity management workflows
- Designed to integrate seamlessly with Vue.js, Quasar, and module federation architecture
