 * Composable providing utility functions to work with the tree component.

 * - the `QTreeNode` structure expected by Quasar's `q-tree` component.
 *
 * It ensures consistent node mapping, key handling, and recursive children
 * conversion across the application.
 * @returns An object exposing tree conversion helpers.
